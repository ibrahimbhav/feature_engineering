### Feature Enginnering Module

The feature engineering module in the deep learning pipeline for biomedical image segmentation using SKlearn, SKImage, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
Includes image preprocessing and transformation techniques, including RGB to HSV conversion and channel extraction, applied filtering and image processing operations like equalization, bilateral filtering, and edge detection to generate nine feature arrays, optimizing model performance for computer vision tasks.
